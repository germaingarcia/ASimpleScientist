Therefore, different strategies are applied to understand this educational phenomenon, although the most outstanding derive from the joint application of statistical approaches and computational techniques based on machine learning. Student Dropout Prediction (SDP) is a challenging problem that can be addressed following various strategies. On the one hand, machine learning approaches formulate it as a classification task whose objective is to compute the probability of belonging to a class based on a specific feature vector that will help us to predict who will drop out. Alternatively, survival analysis techniques are applied in a time-varying context to predict when abandonment will occur. This work considered analytical mechanisms for supporting the decision-making process on higher education dropout. We evaluated different computational methods from both approaches for predicting who and when the dropout occurs and sought those with the most-consistent results. Moreover, our research employed a longitudinal dataset including demographic, socioeconomic, and academic information from six academic departments of a Latin American university over thirteen years. Finally, this study carried out an in-depth analysis, discusses how such variables influence estimating the level of risk of dropping out, and questions whether it occurs at the same magnitude or not according to the academic department, gender, socioeconomic group, and other variables.","tags":["student dropout prediction","machine learning models","survival analysis"],"title":"Supporting Decision-Making Process on Higher Education Dropout by Analyzing Academic, Socioeconomic, and Equity Factors through Machine Learning and Survival Analysis Methods in the Latin American Context","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666969200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666969200,"objectID":"c32a21c634682709931430c2e2dcb13b","permalink":"https://germaingarcia.github.io/ASimpleScientist/talk/sda-vis-a-visualization-system-for-student-dropout-analysis-based-on-counterfactual-exploration/","publishdate":"2022-10-27T15:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ASimpleScientist/talk/sda-vis-a-visualization-system-for-student-dropout-analysis-based-on-counterfactual-exploration/","section":"event","summary":"SDA-Vis A Visualization System for Student Dropout Analysis Based on Counterfactual Exploration","tags":["Education"],"title":"SDA-Vis A Visualization System for Student Dropout Analysis Based on Counterfactual Exploration","type":"event"},{"authors":["Germain Garcia-Zanabria"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666882800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666882800,"objectID":"9553fea0e70e10af88aed19ca37c547c","permalink":"https://germaingarcia.github.io/ASimpleScientist/talk/visual-crime-pattern-analysis/","publishdate":"2022-10-27T15:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ASimpleScientist/talk/visual-crime-pattern-analysis/","section":"event","summary":"Visual crime pattern analysis","tags":["Crime"],"title":"Visual crime pattern analysis","type":"event"},{"authors":["Germain Garcia-Zanabria"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1664629200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664629200,"objectID":"9e939d607cfdb5e6f2e7facfbf1220b6","permalink":"https://germaingarcia.github.io/ASimpleScientist/talk/data-science-for-crime-analysis-in-big-cities/","publishdate":"2022-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ASimpleScientist/talk/data-science-for-crime-analysis-in-big-cities/","section":"event","summary":"Data Science for Crime Analysis in Big Cities","tags":["Crime"],"title":"Data Science for Crime Analysis in Big Cities","type":"event"},{"authors":["Gutierrez-Pachas Daniel A","Germain Garcia-Zanabria","Cuadros-Vargas Alex J","Camara-Chavez Guillermo","Poco, Jorge","Gomez-Nieto Erick"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1648425600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648425600,"objectID":"8b7b1931bd7b7e56e03485e08e297719","permalink":"https://germaingarcia.github.io/ASimpleScientist/publication/howdo/","publishdate":"2022-03-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ASimpleScientist/publication/howdo/","section":"publication","summary":"CrimAnalyzer system - the spatial and temporal interactive views enable the exploration of local regions while revealing their criminal patternsover time.","tags":["curricular design","inclusion","student dropout","survival analysis"],"title":"How Do Curricular Design Changes Impact Computer Science Programs? - A Case Study at San Pablo Catholic University in Peru","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gerar F.

Therefore, those tools can hardly identify micro-scale patterns closely related to crime opportunity, whose understanding is fundamental to the planning of preventive actions. Enabling a combined analysis of spatial patterns and their evolution over time is another challenge faced by most crime analysis tools. In this paper, we present Mirante, a crime mapping visualization system that allows spatiotemporal analysis of crime patterns in a street-level scale. In contrast to conventional tools, Mirante builds upon street-level heatmaps and other visualization resources that enable spatial and temporal pattern analysis, uncovering fine-scale crime hotspots, seasonality, and dynamics over time. Mirante has been developed in close collaboration with domain experts, following rigid requirements as scalability and versatile to be implemented in large and medium-sized cities. We demonstrate the usefulness of Mirante throughout case studies run by domain experts using real data sets from cities with different characteristics. With the help of Mirante, the experts were capable of diagnosing how crime evolves in specific regions of the cities while still being able to raise hypotheses about why certain types of crime show up.","tags":[],"title":"Trajectory Anomaly Detection based on Similarity Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Germain Garcia-Zanabria"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613998800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613998800,"objectID":"1f4bad11b5fc45bf71668b8804f1f7fa","permalink":"https://germaingarcia.github.io/ASimpleScientist/talk/visual-analytics-for-urban-crime-analysis-quantil-colombia/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ASimpleScientist/talk/visual-analytics-for-urban-crime-analysis-quantil-colombia/","section":"event","summary":"Visual Analytics for Urban Crime Analysis","tags":["Crime"],"title":"Visual Analytics for Urban Crime Analysis - Quantil - Colombia","type":"event"},{"authors":["Germain Garcia-Zanabria","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Identification of the student with the highest risk of dropping out is generally used to apply corrective actions (WHO). Therefore, it is also important to determine WHEN a student will drop out, which is fundamental to planning preventive actions. In this work, we perform a study to quantitatively compare several approaches to address the early identification of dropout students in universities. We categorize our study into three main methods families, i.e., analytical methods, traditional classification methods, and probabilistic methods. The first is exploited at preprocessing step for selecting significant variables into the dropout identification task. The second uses machine learning models to classify students into dropout prone or non-dropout prone classes. The third family uses survival models to determine when the student would desert. To evaluate the predictive capacity of the classification models, the Kappa coefficient was incorporated into the usual machine learning metrics and shows that Kappa is handy for evaluating performance in unbalanced data. Similarly, in the survival models, the concordance index was applied to evaluate the predictive capacity. Our approach was applied over a real data set of Peruvian university graduate students to identify when and who will drop out.","tags":[],"title":"A comparative study of WHO and WHEN prediction approaches for early identification of university students at dropout risk","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Despite its usefulness, Star Coordinates bears limitations that impair its use in several scenarios. For instance, when the number of data dimensions is high, the resulting visualization becomes cluttered, hampering the joint analysis of attribute importance and group/pattern formation. In this paper, we propose a novel method that renders Star Coordinates a feasible alternative to analyze high-dimensional data. The proposed method relies on a clustering mechanism to group attributes in order to mitigate visual clutter. Clustering can be performed automatically as well as interactively, allowing the analysis of how particular groups of attributes impact on the radial layout, thus assisting users in the understanding of data. The effectiveness of our approach is shown through a set of experiments and case studies, which attest its usefulness in practical applications.","tags":["Visualization","Multidimensional Data","Star Coordinates"],"title":"iStar (i) An interactive star coordinates approach for high-dimensional data exploration","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Visual Data Crime is a research project that aims at creating computational systems to help identify, understand, and predict criminality.

Our proposal will focus on three main objectives: (Obj 1) Video Analysis, (Obj 2) Social Network Analysis, and (Obj 3) Socioeconomic and Academic Analysis, described below.\nIn Obj 1, Video Analysis, data generated from security cameras installed in educational environments will be studied, and it is divided into three main tasks. The first task focuses on detecting the level of attention of a student in class and their emotional state, which can affect their performance, for example, fatigue, anger, etc. This way, the teacher can identify when their students lose interest and take measures to improve their teaching strategies. The second task is the identification of physical aggression between students so that alerts can be sent to maintain their integrity. The third task is an algorithm that allows for the automatic registration of student attendance so that the institution has up-to-date data on the attendance percentage of its students and can take appropriate actions.\nIn Obj 2, Social Network Analysis, the goal is to process the social interactions of educational communities (students and teachers) to detect verbal violence (cyberbullying) in virtual environments (the web), such as insults, teasing, spreading rumors, among others. This automatic detection will be carried out using deep learning, which will be complemented with social network analysis algorithms to perform an analysis of the interactions between students on social networks.\nFinally, in Obj 3, Socioeconomic and Academic Analysis, we seek to understand and predict the behavior of students using socioeconomic and academic data in order to identify cases of early dropout and low academic performance. For this, a predictive model will be generated that allows for forecasting possible behaviors in students, and the findings will be useful for educators, principals, or decision-makers to develop strategies and solutions to reduce dropout rates and consequently increase academic levels. For these purposes, algorithms based on data science, computer vision, machine learning, deep learning, and stochastic models will be used.\nResearches Germain García Zanabria Erick Gomez Nieto, UCSP Jorge Poco, EMAp/FGV Daniel Gutierrez, USP ","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"da1faa9820a089a596ea94ca77505e9e","permalink":"https://germaingarcia.github.io/ASimpleScientist/project/education/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ASimpleScientist/project/education/","section":"project","summary":"This project proposes to analyze data from educational environments, with the aim of studying relevant issues, challenges, and opportunities for improvement.

In particular, trajectory anomaly detection has a significant practical value, making it possible identifying trajectories that may indicate illegal and adverse activity in diverse areas such as surveillance, tracking devices, traffic, and people flow. This study presents a methodology to detect anomaly trajectories based on their morphology features. For that, we follow two stages:(1) comparative analysis of the performance of two descriptors to group similar trajectories, and (2) trajectory anomaly detection based on their similarities. We define Wavelet and Fourier transforms as trajectory descriptors to generate characteristics and subsequently detect anomalies ones. Our experiments emphasize the measure of the performance in the description of the coefficient feature space using unsupervised learning, specifically clustering techniques, to create subsets and identify irregular ones. The study’s implications demonstrate that it is possible to use descriptors in trajectories for automatic anomaly detection and the use of unsupervised learning to segment required information. Our study’s performance and comparative analysis have been demonstrated throughout multiple experiments. We present some quantitative results using synthetic data sets as well as qualitative analysis throughout two case studies considering real data sets that leave evidence of our contribution.","tags":["Trajectory anomaly detection","trajectory descriptor","feature extraction","trajectory clustering"],"title":"A Feature-based Trajectory Anomaly Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Germain Garcia-Zanabria","Silveira, Jaqueline","Poco Jorge","Paiva, Afonso","Nery, Marcelo Batista","Silva, Claudio T","Adorno, Sergio","Nonato, Luis Gustavo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f841573bf10a763d73e2b8d5220840e7","permalink":"https://germaingarcia.github.io/ASimpleScientist/publication/crimanalyzer/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ASimpleScientist/publication/crimanalyzer/","section":"publication","summary":"CrimAnalyzer system - the spatial and temporal interactive views enable the exploration of local regions while revealing their criminal patternsover time.","tags":["Crime Data","Hotspots","Visual Analytics","Street-Level"],"title":"CrimAnalyzer - Understanding Crime Patterns in São Paulo","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Germain Garcia-Zanabria","Marcos M Raimundo","Jorge Poco","Marcelo Batista Nery","Claudio T Silva","Sergio Adorno","Luis Gustavo Nonato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"80409e46d08d2d7641314ffd3c29d460","permalink":"https://germaingarcia.github.io/ASimpleScientist/publication/cripav/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ASimpleScientist/publication/cripav/","section":"publication","summary":"CriPAV system - Hotspot (b), spatial (a and c), and temporal interactive views (d, e, and f) enabling the exploration of local regions while revealing their criminal patterns over time.","tags":["Crime Data","Hotspots","Visual Analytics","Street-Level"],"title":"CriPAV - Street-Level Crime Patterns Analysis and Visualization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Germain Garcia-Zanabria","Daniel A.
